## Additional Information

The following componenrs from Module 3 were implemented in this activity:
1. Strategy Pattern- for handing different payment strategies.

2. Encapsulation and Polymorphism- I demonstrated these OOP principles in the Payment class, where a single object can work with any payment strategy. This shows how polymorphism allows different behaviors to be used through one unified interface.

3. Abstract class and Methods- I used Pythonâ€™s ABC module and @abstractmethod decorator to create the base PaymentStrategy class. This ensures that all strategies follow the same structure and implement the required process_payment method.
